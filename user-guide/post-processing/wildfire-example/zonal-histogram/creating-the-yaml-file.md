# YAML file

The YAML file is used as a host for the specific configurations that can be used to run SIT-FUSE. Each script in SIT-FUSE will have a YAML file within the repository that can be run with it.

Duplicating, modifying and renaming these YAML files as needed is a simple way to run SIT-FUSE, as these files will have all of the  code configurations for that script set, minus the user specified values.&#x20;

See [code-configuration](../../../code-configuration/ "mention") for specific guidelines and examples on how to configure different YAML files for different scripts/processes.
