# Sourcing in-situ data

In-situ data is comprised of measurements taken at a location of interest using instruments physically present at the site. In our HAB case, for example, the in-situ data would be concentrations of different photoplankton species, information about the surrounding body of water (temperature, depth, salinity, etc.), locations of the sites, dates and times, and various chemical concentrations.

In-situ data is critical for the labeling process as it serves as our labels for the context assignment

talk about the csv data and how you got it (download) and fixed it with py. (strip time, remove stuff greater than certain depth)
