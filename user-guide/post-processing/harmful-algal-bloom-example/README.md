# Harmful Algal Bloom Example

### Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) are large outbreaks of algae in oceans and lakes that harm coastal ecosystems, fisheries, and public health.&#x20;

#### Monitoring has been expensive and difficult historically – algal blooms change rapidly and tracking requires instrument-specific retrieval algorithms, which can be difficult and expensive to develop.
