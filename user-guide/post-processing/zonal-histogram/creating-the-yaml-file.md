# Creating the YAML file

**There are many ways to create and edit YAML files, but the way we recommend is as follows:**

The steps to creating a YAML file will differ depending on the specifc IDE or editor you are using.

For instance, in PyCharm, first right click on any file in the Project window , then select `New -> Edit File Templates...` and click the `+` plus button that says `Create Template` when hovered over. Now, give the template a name (e.g. `YAML`) and for the extension write `yaml`. Then click `OK` and now when you go to `New` to create a new file, you can select the YAML template from the bottom and create a YAML file that way.

Again, this varies with editors, so we'd recommend searching for documentation and/or playing around with your editor.

**Another way:**

There are example YAML files for each type of code configuration needed to run SIT FUSE in the git repository, so you could duplicate those files, modifying and renaming as needed. However, we'd still recommend creating the template in your IDE for easier creation and modification in the future.
