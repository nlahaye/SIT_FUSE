# MultiModalObj
Multi-Sensor Segmentation and Instance Tracking using Unsupervised Deep Learning

Supports multi-GPU training via PyTorch's DDP class

Uses Learnergy for RBM-based models:

Using my fork - https://github.com/nlahaye/learnergy
   primary version - https://github.com/gugarosa/learnergy/

Scikit-Learn, Dask, and Dask-ML are used mostly
  Currently transitioning from numpy to Dask and from Scikit-Learn to Dask-ML wherever possible
